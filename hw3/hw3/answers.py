part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

We split the corpus into sequences instead of training on the whole text in order to avoid vanishing or exploding
gradients, and because we usually cannot fit the whole corpus into the GPU memory.

"""

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**

It is possible that the generated text shows memory longer than the sequence length because we are
propagating the hidden state between sequences, and that way we keep the context of previous characters seen.

"""

part1_q3 = r"""
**Your answer:**

We are not shuffling the order of batches when training, because we want to keep semantic context of the
hidden layer between adjacent sequences.

Write your answer using **markdown** and $\LaTeX$:
